# 📊 Suicide Rate Trends Analysis – Python Data Science Project

This project explores global suicide rate trends using Python and aims to uncover key patterns and insights related to mental health, gender, age, and socioeconomic factors. The analysis is based on structured datasets and leverages powerful visualization and machine learning techniques.

## 🧠 Problem Overview

Suicide is a serious public health issue, and understanding its patterns across different countries, age groups, and genders is vital for effective intervention. This project focuses on analyzing historical data to:

- Detect countries with the highest suicide rates
- Understand trends across gender and age
- Investigate economic and social factors contributing to suicide



## 📁 Dataset Summary

The dataset used includes suicide rates across various countries over several years, along with demographic and economic indicators such as:

- `country`: Country name
- `year`: Year of observation
- `sex`: Gender (male/female)
- `age`: Age group
- `suicides_no`: Total suicides recorded
- `population`: Population of that group
- `suicides/100k pop`: Suicide rate
- `gdp_per_capita`: GDP per capita (USD)
- `generation`: Generation (e.g., Boomers, Gen X)



## 🔧 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Plotly
- Scikit-learn (for clustering or modeling)
- Jupyter Notebook



## 🔍 Implementation Steps

### 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing
- Loaded and cleaned the dataset
- Handled missing values
- Converted data types where necessary

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized global suicide trends over years
- Compared suicide rates across genders and age groups
- Identified top 10 countries with the highest average suicide rates
- Created interactive and static visualizations to show year-wise trends

### 3️⃣ Statistical Analysis
- Performed correlation analysis between GDP and suicide rate
- Analyzed age group patterns and gender disparities
- Explored generational impact on suicide trends

### 4️⃣ Advanced Insights
- Clustering countries based on suicide rates
- Heatmaps and pair plots to reveal relationships
- Time series trends for individual countries

## 📊 Key Findings

- **Males** consistently show higher suicide rates than females.
- **Older age groups**, particularly 75+, have the highest suicide rates.
- **GDP per capita** is not always negatively correlated with suicide rate—wealthier countries also showed significant suicide numbers.
- **Japan, Russia, Lithuania, and South Korea** frequently appeared in top lists for suicide rates.

## 🔮 Future Scope

- Add machine learning models for predictive analysis
- Include additional indicators like education level, urbanization, or mental health index
- Build a public awareness dashboard using Tableau or Power BI
